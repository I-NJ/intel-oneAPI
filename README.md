## A Brief of the Prototype:
  Processing medical images can indeed be time-consuming, especially when dealing with large datasets. However, there are several ways to optimize medical image processing using SYCL to improve accuracy and speed of diagnosis. SYCL is a C++-based programming model that enables efficient acceleration of heterogeneous systems, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. It allows developers to write code in standard C++, while also exploiting the parallelism of modern hardware. This makes it an ideal tool for optimizing medical image processing.
  
## Tech Stack: 
   List Down all technologies used to Build the prototype **Clearly mentioning Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits, it's libraries and the SYCL/DCP++ Libraries used**
   Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits : 
   Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits provide optimized libraries and tools for accelerating machine learning and deep learning workloads on Intel® hardware
   Libraries we are using are ->
   1. Intel® oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN): This library provides optimized routines for deep learning workloads, including convolutional neural     networks (CNNs) that can be used for image classification.
   2. Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit: This toolkit provides optimized libraries for computer vision tasks, including object detection and image segmentation, which could be useful for detecting skin lesions in medical images.
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  We are still in the Idea phase
  
## What I Learned:
